1. [x] Perhaps split the "content area" in to two more columns?
	1. Can this be done on an individual view basis? Wrapped around a "application" level layout
		[x] - No, there is a plugin that supports nested layouts, but seems kind of hackish
	2. Remove the "side bar" from applicaton.rhtml. Each view is responsible for displaying things in a "right_side" and "left_side" fashion
		[x] - Completed 10/3/2007
	
	3. Need to make a "graphic" of the site layout and how to use the available CSS classes.
	
2. Edit Settings Interface - allowing users to specify Personal Information
	* Yahoo, AIM, MSN, GTalk
	* Email addresses (work and personal - optional)
	* Contact Numbers (work, cell, home)
	* Contact Times
	* Google Number (so far this is for Scott's "Shared Feed Reader")
		[x] - This was attached to the user model
	
3. Integrate Scott's "Google Shared Items" in to the Portal
	* http://djangovm:3000/feeds
		[x] - Completed 10/6/2007
	* Need to integrate "feeds" in to the "User" model somehow?
		* [x] - Completed 10/6/2007: Added user.shared_feeds
			
	* Need to talk with Scott about a decent way to integrate this.
		* [x] I think we decided that user.google_number was suffecient
		* [x] This will need to be setup in the "Settings" area so that "Shared" feeds will automatically be imported

4. Need to clean up "login" and "signup"
	[x] - This is "working" better. Mostly needs UI enhancements
	* What happens when browsing the portal when you're not logged in? (Need to document this)
		* What CRUD actions should I be allowed to do?
	* "Logout" should be displayed when you're logged in.
		[x] Completed 10/9/2007
	* I need a mechanism for determining if a user is logged in or not (user.logged_in?)
		[x] Discovered logged_in? - 10/9/2007
		[x] This exists in AuthenticatedSystem of restful_authentication
			Example: if (logged_in?)
	* "Login" should be displayed with "Signup" when you're NOT logged in.
		[x] - Implemented restful_authentication plugin - 10/9/2007
	
5. Clean up "routes"
	* I need to decide whether or not I like nested routes or not.
		[x] Completed

6. Get TinyMCE working with entering/editing posts in a blog
	[x] Completed - 10/8/2007
	* This probably needs to be cleaned up when I go back through and refactor forms in to partials
		[x] Completed 10/9/2007

* Need to put the Post forms in to a partial to share between New and Edit.
	[x] Completed - 10/9/2007
	* Needs to be refactored

7. "/blogs" should display a list of recently updated blogs from ALL users
	* Should this be grouped by "Users" or would it just be a list of all blogs?
	* Should it not display blogs at all? Perhaps it should just display the most recent "Posts" from the blog
	* UI definitely needs some work in this area

* Need to figure out what to display on /pages/index

8. "News Feed" concept on "/users/:id"
	[x] - Completed 10/5/2007
	* This is an aggregation of things that have happened all over the site
		[x] Completed - 10/7/2007 - Works for posts and comments
		* Content that has been updated
			[x] 10/5/2007 (Bryan Ray)
		* People that have changed preferences that have changes
		* New Content that has been added
			[x] - Bryan Ray - 10/5/2007
	* Add settings that allow users to specify what type of content they want to see
	
* Where to store site settings, user settings, etc?
	* acts_as_configurable?
	
* Need to figure out how to handle "Versions" of "Content"
	[x] Completed - Implemented acts_as_versioned - 10/7/2007
	* Need to decide if I like the "acts_as_versioned" plugin ... might have to strip it out.
		* I don't know if I like the fact that versions return "#{Model}Version" and don't have access to the models associations
	
* Should probably implement acts_as_paranoid on "Content"

* Need to implement tagging on Page model
	[x] Completed - 10/16/2007
* Need to implement tagging on Post model
	[x] Completed - 10/21/2007
	
* Need to add the UI for tagging the content in Posts and Pages (wiki)
	[x] Completed for Pages - 10/21/2007
	
* Need to cleanup the "Blog" partial. Display "Edit Blog" with "Create a new blog"

9. Editing a post form needs to be cleaned up
	* Some cleanup work done 10/1/2007
	* Some cleanup work done 10/3/2007
	* Some cleanup work done 10/20/2007
	* Some cleanup work done 10/22/2007

10. Need to clean up the "/signup" form ...
	[x] Some work done on 10/9/2007
	* Include first_name and last_name
		[x] - Completed - 10/11/2007
	* Make it more "web 2.0ish"
	
11. Posts need to have comments
	[x] Completed - 10/10/2007
	* Ended up putting comments on Content.
		[x] 10/8/2007 - Actually Comments are polymorphic so they can belong to any model who uses "acts_as_commentable"
	* Where do Comments go? Should Post have comments? Content have comments?
		[x] 10/8/2007 - Polymorphic so it doesn't matter
	* Need to fix up the UI on "Post Comments" ... it's very ugly right now

12. Possibly move "text" from Post model in to the "Content" model.
	[x] Completed - 10/7/2007
	* Need to do some design analysis to figure out a good way to model this
		[x] - Completed
	
13. Need to merge Team_Portal in to TeamPortal
	[x] Completed 10/2/2007
	* "Team_Portal" should be a branch probably and then "merge"
	* Or maybe just delete "TeamPortal" and start with the new "Team_Portal" ... what would I lose?

* To Do List 
	* Allow developers to organize a "To Do List"
	
* Status Management (Twitter concept instead?)
	* Display the entire list of items done during a day in a "Standup" type fashion
	* Allow developers to enter in what they've done during a day
	* Put updates as to what a team member is working on
	* Allow users to "follow" other users ... getting updates whenever they enter new tasks they've completed

* Developer Blogs
	* Perhaps tie blogs to specific "Test Track" or "CIMS" issues
	* Allow anyone to subscribe to specific "Blog Tags" ... so they can be informed anytime someone blogs on something related
	* Define concepts of "tags" so that they can be related
		* Need a nice "Auto Complete System" for adding Tags to a piece of content

* Employee Management System
	* Knowledge Information
		* Allow "users" to specify what knowledge they know about a set of DataCert products
		* A sort of "rating" system on how well they know the specific knowledge topic
		* This would allow a central place for anyone in the company to go to find who knows the most about specific topics
	* Personal Information (cell phone, work phone, messenger names, emails)
	* Contact Hours
	* SMS Messaging
	
* Library System
	* Who owns what books
	* Who has books "checked out"
