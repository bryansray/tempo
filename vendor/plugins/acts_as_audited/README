= acts_as_audited

acts_as_audited is an ActiveRecord extension that logs all changes to your models in an audits table.

== Auditing in Rails

If you're using acts_as_audited within Rails, you can simply declare which models should be audited.  acts_as_audited can also automatically record the user that made the change if your controller has a <tt>current_user</tt> method.

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    audit User, List, Item
  protected
    def current_user
      @user ||= User.find(session[:user])
    end
  end
  
== Customizing

To get auditing outside of Rails, or to customize which fields are audited within Rails, you can explicitly declare <tt>acts_as_audited</tt> on your models:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_audited :except => [:password, :mistress]
    end

See http://opensoul.org/2006/07/21/acts_as_audited for more information.

== Installation

# Install the plugin into your rails app
    script/plugin install http://source.collectiveidea.com/public/rails/plugins/acts_as_audited
    
# Generate the migration
    script/generate audited_migration add_audits_table
    rake db:migrate

== Caveats

Auditing with user support depends on Rails' caching mechanisms, therefore auditing isn't enabled during development mode. To test that auditing is working, start up your app in production mode, or change the following options in config/environments/environment.rb: 

  config.cache_classes = true
  config.action_controller.perform_caching = true

=== ActiveScaffold

Many users have also reported problems with acts_as_audited and ActiveScaffold, which appears to be caused by a limitation in ActiveScaffold not supporting polymorphic associations. To get it to work with ActiveScaffold:

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    audit MyModel, :only => [:create, :update, :destroy]
  end

== Upgrading

To upgrade from an older version, add a migration with:

  # to version 0.3
  add_column :audits, :user_type, :string
  add_column :audits, :username, :string

  # to version 0.4
  add_column :audits, :version, :integer, :default => 0
